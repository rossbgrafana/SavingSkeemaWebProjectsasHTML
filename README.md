# SavingSkeemaWebProjectsasHTML
"Skeema is a human-centered way to manage your tabs that helps you declutter your mind and your browser."

However, they don't provide a human-centric method for saving off your data, so I had to figure out how to make the "Shared" pages you can send to people able to be saved as regular HTML.

Hey, it's not perfect, but with just a simple line addition to the top of the saved "web page complete" you have an HTML file that contains your shared links from that Skeema Project!
