# Saving Skeema Projects to Disk as a Backup HTML file

SO, I have solved how to save a Skeema HTML saved file so that it shows all the content, or at least the URL's, and you can save your Projects off to an HTML file that can be used for a backup...

## Steps to Do (Endure):
1. You have to go to the project's page in Skeema in your browser
2. Hit the **Share** icon
3. Slide the slider over to show blue on the **Get viewer link** section
4. Click the **Open in new tab** icon to the right of the URL dialog, which is a small square with an arrow pointing to the top right of the square
5. This will open the Shared Skeema page in a new tab
6. Use the **FILE -> SAVE** function in your browser to save the file locally, using the **__Webpage, Complete__** format.  NOTE:  This will NOT work otherwise.
7. Edit the HTML file you saved to disk, and at the top of the file you'll find a line that is similar to the below:
    ```
    <!-- saved from url=(0045)https://web.skeema.com/p/bAxcuK8tnH5Yvz8qeTyD -->
    ```
8.  While in that file, add a line to the TOP of the file that uses that URL where you see my SKEEMASHAREURLHERE in the example below:
    ```
    <base href="SKEEMASHAREURLHERE">
    ```
9.  This will give you a file with the top two lines that look like this:
    ```
    <base href="https://web.skeema.com/p/bAxcuK8tnH5Yvz8qeTyD">
    <!-- saved from url=(0045)https://web.skeema.com/p/bAxcuK8tnH5Yvz8qeTyD -->
    ```
10.  Save this file, it's now able to show the URL's from the Skeema page you saved.
11.  Just load it in the browser by double-clicking on it or use the **FILE -> OPEN** menu option.

**Note:**  yes, there are things that could work better, all the circles and fancy icons aren't working, but you can now save your project pages locally and not LOSE everything if Skeema goes away.
